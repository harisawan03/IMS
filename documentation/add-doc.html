    <h3>Adding Items to Inventory</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="docs">
        <p>
          As noted before, when adding an item you may come across one of two 
          possibilties, the item already exisits in the database or it does not. 
          The system will automatically detect if it exists or not based on the UPC
          and redirect you accordingly.
          <br><br>
          If the UPC is not recognized, your only option (as seen on the basic usage 
          intro page) will be to add the item.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If the item does already exist in the inventory and the UPC was not 
            recognized, the scanner may have not properly read the bar code. In this
            case, return to the homepage and try again. If the problem persists and
            you have verified the item does already exist in the inventory, see
            <a href="custom-sql.html">the custom SQL documentation</a>. <strong>
            But be sure you understand SQL before proceeding!</strong>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The form to add a new item will be mostly blank with only Amount being added 
          pre-populated. Change the amount as necessary and fill in 
          blank fields with the desired data. Notice that the detected UPC is 
          displayed at the top for the purpose of verifying it was read properly 
          by the scanner.
        </p>

        <p>
          Should the scanned UPC already exist in the database, the system will 
          auto-populate the Item Name, Category, and Bin fields. In addition, 
          it will not allow for these fields to be changed. This is emphasized 
          to the user by the field being greyed out. Simply enter the amount to 
          be added and continue.

          Hitting add will update the database accordingly and redirect you to 
          the confirmation page. Here the new quantities, for both owned and 
          available, will be displayed.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Be sure not to go back to the add page.</strong> Doing so 
            may cause discrepencies in database.
