    <h3>Explanations of Key Decisions Made During Development</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="docs">
      <p>
        Below we will discuss why certain design decisions were made. This is so 
        that users are aware of potentially confusing outcomes as well as to give 
        an understanding of why particular features exist as they currently do.
      </p>
      <h4>Data Only Available through SQL</h4>
      <p> 
        There is much data viewable only through using SQL, as we have gone over. 
        This is for the purpose of keeping the app simple and to offer a clean 
        and easy user experience. While there is plenty of data that we want to 
        view that is not available in the app, its inclusion within would 
        certainly clog up the interface. The IMS app itself serves a very specific 
        purpose. That is, to simplify and streamline movement and alteration of 
        IT inventory items. There is some important tracking displayed 
        during normal usage, however this is mainly for confirmation purposes that 
        the user sees that he or she is making the correct changes to the inventory 
        based on what is happening to an item physically. That being said, a future 
        feature may include the ability to view advanced data through the web app.
      </p> 
      <h4>Inventory Counts Going Negative and Available being Greather Than Owned</h4>
      <p>
        It may come to your attention, from time to time, that your counts may go 
        negative (this may occur with the number available or owned) or the total 
        available is greater than total owned. You will notice this in-app as you 
        are going about normal procedures. In fact, you may even proactively 
        notice as you are trying to, for example, check out an item and the count 
        is already at zero or when checking in an item and owned and available 
        are already equal. Be aware that you will not even recieve a warning for 
        what you are about to do. The primary reason is so that ordinary usage of 
        the app is not inturrpted. Should there be some discrepency in the 
        database, it is preffered that normal operation can go on in getting items 
        checked in and out. Then, once there is a chance, the issue can be 
        investigate in the logs and the physical inventory and proceed to be fixed 
        in a timely manner. 
        <br><br> 
        One might think that preventing negative counts or available being greater 
        than owned would keep discrepencies from occurring in the databse. This is 
        true that it will keep the program from creating these issues, but it does 
        not prevent the user from doing it. Human error is an unavoidable part of 
        life.
