        Below we will discuss why certain design decisions were made. This is so 
        that users are aware of potentially confusing outcomes as well as to give 
        an understanding of why particular features exist as they currently do.

      <h4 id="anchor-one">Data Only Available Through SQL</h4>
      <p> 
        There is much data viewable only through using SQL, as we have gone over. 
        This is for the purpose of keeping the app simple and to offer a clean 
        and easy user experience. While there is plenty of data that we want to 
        view that is not available in the app, its inclusion within would 
        certainly clog up the interface. The IMS app itself serves a very specific 
        purpose. That is, to simplify and streamline the movement and alteration of 
        IT inventory items. There is some important tracking displayed 
        during normal usage, however, this is mainly for confirmation purposes that 
        the user sees that he or she is making the correct changes to the inventory 
        based on what is happening to an item physically. That being said, a future 
        feature may include the ability to view advanced data through the web app.
      </p> 
      <h4 id="anchor-two">Inventory Counts Going Negative and Available being Greater Than Owned</h4>
      <p>
        It may come to your attention, from time to time, that your counts can go 
        negative (this may occur with the number available or owned) or the total 
        available is greater than total owned. You will notice this in-app as you 
        are going about normal procedures. In fact, you may even proactively 
        notice as you are trying to, for example, check out an item and the count 
        is already at zero or when checking in an item and owned and available 
        are already equal. Be aware that you will not even receive a warning for 
        what you are about to do. The primary reason is so that ordinary usage of 
        the app is not interrupted. Should there be some discrepancy in the 
        database, it is preferred that normal operation can go on in getting items 
        checked in and out. Then, once there is a chance, the issue can be 
        investigated in the logs and the physical inventory and proceed to be fixed 
        in a timely manner. 
        <br><br> 
        One might think that preventing negative counts or available being greater 
        than owned would keep discrepancies from occurring in the database. This is 
        true that it will keep the program from creating these issues, but it does 
        not prevent the user from doing it. Human error is an unavoidable part of 
        life.
      </p>
      <h4 id="anchor-three">UPC is Scanned Then an Action Chosen and Not the Other Way Around</h4>
      <p>
        In the original plan for the UI and UX of this app, the user was greeted 
        with the action page. Upon choosing what they were doing, they would then 
        be directed to a scanner to begin the process of whatever action was chosen. 
        So why then is the end product the opposite? It ended up being easier to 
        program more efficiently and it seems to be more of a natural flow. 
        <br><br>
        In regards to being easier and more efficient, the biggest thing was being 
        able to have the scanner do only one thing. There was no need to program 
        multiple paths for the scanner to have to decide to be a part of based on 
        what action it came from. One scanner page allows for it to simply 
        detect a barcode, save the necessary data, then have a singular page to 
        direct the user to every time. It is then solely up to the next page to 
        figure out what it should do. That is, there is no need for the scanner to 
        figure out what the check-in page should do.
      </p>
      <h4 id="anchor-four">Items not Deleted Completely Within App</h4>
      <p>
        The initial thought was for the user to be prompted with a choice whether 
        or not to completely remove an item from the inventory when the total 
        owned becomes zero. The decision was made against this to keep the flow of 
        the app as smooth as possible, to prevent accidental deletion from the 
        inventory, and to defer the decision to a time when it may make more sense 
        to completely remove it (i.e. when there is a low chance of more ever being 
        added).
      </p>
      <h4 id="anchor-five">Employees Unable to be Added Within App</h4>
      <p>
        Two major reasons determine the inability to add employees from within 
        the app (as well as deleting employees). First, as this is an <i>Inventory</i> 
        Management System, it makes sense to keep it from also doing the job of 
        managing employees as well. This goes with the running pattern of keeping 
        things simple. Second, adding (and deleting) employees will be a relatively 
        infrequent task. So again, there is no reason to add the complexity.
      </p> 
      <h4 id="anchor-six">Auto-Detect if UPC Already Exists</h4>
      <p>
        This one is sort of a given. The simple explanation here has to do with 
        making the user experience as smooth as possible as well as eliminating 
        human error. Additionally, it saves the user having to figure out if it 
        exists or not and it prevents the user from having to start over if trying 
        to check out an item that turned out to not have been added to the inventory 
        yet. You simply are only given the option to add an item to the inventory 
        if it currently does not exist in it. This also prevents a UPC being added 
        that is already associated with another item. This is already prevented 
        within the database, where UPC is required to be a unique value, but it 
        does not hurt to add extra precautions in order to avoid unseeable errors.
