    <h3>Viewing Advanced Data</h3>

    <div class="docs">
      <p>
        Often times, you may wish to view data that is not displayed during 
        regular usage of the Inventory Management System. To do so, a handful of 
        SQL queries are saved on the server. These are saved at 
        <i>D:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA</i> 
        as <i>view_data.sql</i> 
      </p>

      <p>  
        We will now go into each query as well as the table it produces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here we have two very similar and simple tables. The queries shown use an
        asterisk to select all columns from the it_inventory and employees tables 
        respectively. The resulting tables are shown containing some example data 
        used during development to test functionality.
        <br><br>
        Viewing the it_inventory will likely be an especially common practice in 
        order to view the current state of the IT inventory. Owned and available 
        numbers are changed by normal usage and numbers shown here will be the 
        same as numbers shown within the app.

      <p>
        Next are tables that track when an item is checked in or out and when an 
        item is added or removed from the inventory. The item tracker is for the 
        purpose of seeing who is checking items in or out, when, and how many. The 
        add/remove log tracks items being added to and removed from the inventory, 
        when they are added/removed, the amount, and the reason. 
        <br><br>
        As you may have noticed, these two simple queries are only useful insofar 
        as one knows the item's and employee's IDs. For this reason, queries were 
        written to give a simplified view for the purpose of tracking these 
        important pieces of data.
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      <p>
        These queries are a bit more complex, but the tables they produce make 
        viewing changes to the inventory much more easily read. In fact, they are 
        structured so that they can be read in a more natural way. For example, 
        "Haris checked out a 13 inch MacBook Pro on 2020-03-16." or "One 13 inch 
        MacBook Pro was removed on 2020-03-16 because it was broken." 
        <br><br>
        The queries here use Inner Joins in order to select matching values 
        between two tables. This, in turn, makes it possible to display an item 
        or employee name in a table, as opposed to the more vague IDs.
